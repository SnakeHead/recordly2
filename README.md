Recordly Code Challenge

Summary:  This is a basic application which allows users to view, add, edit and delete artists.
The app requires users to create an account (or sign in if they've already created one) in order to use it.

Note:  The app currently only works with artists.  The complete application if given the time (was asked to only spend about an hour on it) would allow users to add an artist's albums and the related songs to each album.


The complete application would:

* When viewing an artist you would be able to view the artist's albums and then drill down to their list of songs.

* Ensure that the data is related - An Artist can have several Albums and each Album can have one or more songs.

* Ensure data validation on all the input forms - ie: no blank records should be created, etc.

* Add ability to mark “favorites” (Artists, Albums, & Songs).

I would also create a database table to contain the genre in order to dynamically populate the genre dropdowns within the app.

{Optionally} provide a way to edit the Genres.

Perform unit testing of the application.
